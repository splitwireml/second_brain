# Wiki Schema

## Domain
Fitness, strength training, bodybuilding, nutrition, and physical performance. Covers training methodology, exercise science, nutrition principles, program design, recovery, and supplementation.

## Conventions
- File names: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces (e.g., `progressive-overload.md`)
- Every wiki page starts with YAML frontmatter (see below)
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to link between pages (minimum 2 outbound links per page)
- When updating a page, always bump the `updated` date
- Every new page must be added to `index.md` under the correct section
- Every action must be appended to `log.md`
- **Provenance markers:** On pages that synthesize 3+ sources, append `^[raw/articles/source-file.md]`
  at the end of paragraphs whose claims come from a specific source. This lets a reader trace each
  claim back without re-reading the whole raw file. Optional on single-source pages where the
  `sources:` frontmatter is enough.

## Frontmatter
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Page Title
  created: YYYY-MM-DD
  updated: YYYY-MM-DD
  type: entity | concept | comparison | query | summary
  tags: [from taxonomy below]
  sources: [raw/articles/source-name.md]
  # Optional quality signals:
  confidence: high | medium | low        # how well-supported the claims are
  contested: true                        # set when the page has unresolved contradictions
  contradictions: [other-page-slug]      # pages this one conflicts with
  ---
  ```

`confidence` and `contested` are optional but recommended for opinion-heavy or fast-moving
topics. Lint surfaces `contested: true` and `confidence: low` pages for review so weak claims
don't silently harden into accepted wiki fact.

## raw/ Frontmatter

Raw sources ALSO get a small frontmatter block so re-ingests can detect drift:

```yaml
---
source_url: https://example.com/article
ingested: YYYY-MM-DD
sha256: <hex digest of the raw content below the frontmatter>
---
```

## Tag Taxonomy
[Define top-level tags for the fitness domain. Add new tags here BEFORE using them.]

- Training: strength, hypertrophy, endurance, cardio, mobility, program-design, periodization
- Nutrition: protein, carbs, fats, calories, supplementation, cutting, bulking, meal-planning
- Physiology: muscle-growth, recovery, hormones, sleep, stress, injury
- Exercises: compound, isolation, barbell, dumbbell, machine, bodyweight, cardio
- Goals: muscle-gain, fat-loss, strength-goals, body-composition, performance
- Equipment: gym, home-gym, barbells, dumbbells, machines, cables
- Meta: comparison, timeline, controversy, evidence, methodology

## Page Thresholds
- **Create a page** when an entity/concept appears in 2+ sources OR is central to one source
- **Add to existing page** when a source mentions something already covered
- **DON'T create a page** for passing mentions, minor details, or things outside the domain
- **Split a page** when it exceeds ~200 lines — break into sub-topics with cross-links
- **Archive a page** when its content is fully superseded — move to `_archive/`, remove from index

## Entity Pages
One page per notable entity (person, organization, product, program). Include:
- Overview / what it is
- Key facts and dates
- Relationships to other entities ([[wikilinks]])
- Source references

## Concept Pages
One page per concept or topic. Include:
- Definition / explanation
- Current state of knowledge
- Open questions or debates
- Related concepts ([[wikilinks]])

## Comparison Pages
Side-by-side analyses. Include:
- What is being compared and why
- Dimensions of comparison (table format preferred)
- Verdict or synthesis
- Sources

## Update Policy
When new information conflicts with existing content:
1. Check the dates — newer sources generally supersede older ones
2. If genuinely contradictory, note both positions with dates and sources
3. Mark the contradiction in frontmatter: `contradictions: [page-name]`
4. Flag for user review in the lint report

## Wiki Health Rules
- Every page needs minimum 2 outbound wikilinks
- Pages over 200 lines get flagged for splitting
- Tags must come from the taxonomy above
- Provenance markers required on multi-source synthesis pages
