69 Best Open-Source AI Repositories in April 2026

the average AI startup pays $8,000–$50,000/year in tool subscriptions.

the people actually building AI - researchers, engineers, indie hackers - use open-source. they always have.

i went through 300+ repos. pulled out 69 that are production-ready, actively maintained, and genuinely useful.

this is the full AI stack. free.

## This is the toolbox.

what's inside:

- 01 llm inference - run models locally. no api. no limits. no bill.

- 02 rag & knowledge - make ai answer from your own data.

- 03 ai agents - let the model act, not just answer.

- 04 prompts & evals - stop guessing. start measuring.

- 05 fine-tuning -make the model yours.

- 06 tools & context -feed the model what it actually needs.

- 07 deployment -ship it. then scale it.

- 08 claude-specific - if you use claude, these are not optional.

- 09 data prep - garbage in, garbage out. fix the input.

- 10 vision & multimodal - beyond text.

- 69 bonus - don't want to run all this yourself?
