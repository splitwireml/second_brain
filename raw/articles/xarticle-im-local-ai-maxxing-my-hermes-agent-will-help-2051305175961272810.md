# I'm Local AI Maxxing - My Hermes Agent Will Help

I'm Local AI Maxxing - My Hermes Agent Will Help

this morning I tore out half my AI agent and rebuilt it almost completely. deleted 17 skills, archived 3 months of researches and pointed the entire system at a single mission: learn everything about running AI locally.

this is the story of that pivot, the architecture I built to replace what I deleted, and why I think anyone serious about AI in 2026 should be thinking about local-first setups right now.

---

## The Pivot

I run an agent called Oz. it lives on a Mac Mini M4 with 16GB of unified memory, sits on my desk, and runs 24/7 on hermes (the open-source agent framework from Nous Research).

for the past three months, Oz has been doing two jobs: researching DeFi (stablecoin pegs, RWA tokenisation, LP mechanics, protocol exploits) and researching AI (new models, inference frameworks, benchmarks, agent tooling). roughly 50/50 split.

the DeFi side produced genuinely useful work. Oz tracked stablecoin peg deviations, monitored CDP risk, generated daily briefings with verified sources, and drafted content for my X account. the research was good. the drafts were not. I have 39,000 characters of content voice instructions loaded into the agent. the model still produces AI slop. generic structures, manufactured punchlines, symmetric sentence patterns. every draft needed 50-80% rewriting. the research gave me the raw material. the writing had to be mine.

that's the first thing I accepted this morning: Oz is not a writer. Oz is a researcher. trying to make glm-5.1 sound like me was a losing game, and every hour spent polishing its output was an hour I could have spent learning something. so I made a hard decision: Oz stops drafting content. completely. from today, the agent researches.

I read what it finds. I write what I learn. clean separation.

the second thing that clicked is bigger. I've been posting about local AI all week: hardware guides, model comparisons, token economics, runtime tier lists... and I realised I was writing about a subject I hadn't fully committed to learning. I was pulling from research sessions and model benchmarks but I wasn't building the systematic knowledge base that would make me an expert over time. I was skimming the surface and sharing what I found, which is fine for a few posts but not sustainable if I want to be the person people trust on this topic.

so the pivot: Oz now does one thing. it researches and documents everything about running AI locally. models, quantisation, inference engines, hardware optimisation, fine-tuning, RAG, agent deployment, and anything else that touches the question "how do I run capable AI on my own machine." the DeFi mission is archived. every skill, every cron job, every research pipeline related to stablecoins, RWA, LP mechanics, protocol monitoring. all gone.

## Five Layers

the architecture I built this morning has five layers. I'll walk through each one because I think the pattern is replicable for anyone who wants to build a research agent on their own hardware.

> Layer 1: The Wiki.

this is the core. Andrej Karpathy posted about maintaining a personal wiki as a way to compound knowledge. write it once, keep it current, cross-reference everything. I adopted that pattern for Oz.

there's a structured wiki at ~/wiki/ on the Mac Mini. pages are organised by type: concepts (like gguf, kv-cache, quantisation formats), entities (ollama, specific models, key people), setups (apple silicon inference guides), comparisons (side-by-side analyses), and raw source material. every page has standardised frontmatter with title, creation date, last update, type, tags from a fixed taxonomy of 16 categories, and source URLs. pages link to each other with wikilinks.

today the wiki has 5 seed pages. by the end of the month it should have 30+. by the end of the quarter, 100+. the point isn't to write a wiki. the point is that the wiki gets smarter every day without me manually maintaining it.

> Layer 2: The Research Pipeline.

Oz runs 11 cron jobs throughout the day, all delivering findings to my telegram. the daily flow looks like this:

- 7am: morning scan. what dropped overnight on huggingface daily papers, trending models, and new GGUF uploads.

- 8:30am: hardware and setup intel. apple silicon optimisation tips, new inference guides, setup tutorials.

- 9am onwards: model tracker and breaking news. runs multiple times daily, catching new model releases and framework updates from huggingface, reddit, github, RSS feeds, and DuckDuckGo searches.

- 2pm: deep research session. this is the primary one. huggingface papers, trending models, GGUF tracker, full model cards with benchmarks, arxiv papers on quantisation/KV-cache/compression/efficient inference, and general web searches. the agent goes deep on one or two topics and produces structured findings.

- 6pm: benchmark and quantisation research. focused specifically on inference frameworks, quantisation methods, and performance comparisons.

- 8pm: the compounding step. the research-deepdive cron takes the single best finding from the day and writes a new wiki page. structured, tagged, cross-referenced, sourced. this is how the wiki grows automatically.

- 9pm: health check. system monitoring, state database maintenance, model rotation.

- sunday 8am: weekly synthesis. full wiki lint (orphan detection, broken links, index completeness, stale page flagging) plus gap analysis that identifies 3-5 topics the wiki should cover but doesn't yet.

- monday, wednesday, friday at 1pm: quiz. Oz generates questions from the wiki pages and model catalog and sends them to telegram. this is the reinforcement loop. knowledge goes in, gets structured, gets tested.

> Layer 3: Huggingface as The Primary Intelligence Source.

I made a deliberate decision to treat huggingface as the "github of AI" and build Oz's research around its API. model cards on huggingface are more reliable than blog posts. the metadata is structured. the API is free and rich. I wrote four bash scripts that query different endpoints:

1. hf-papers.sh

pulls daily curated papers filtered by 30+ local AI keywords (quantisation, inference, GGUF, MLX, ollama, KV-cache, etc).

2.    hf-trending.sh

shows trending text-generation models sorted by weekly likes.

3.    hf-gguf-tracker.sh

tracks new GGUF uploads with modes for all uploads, known quantisers only, or brand new uploaders.

4.    hf-model-card.sh

pulls full model metadata, README content, and benchmark tables for any model by name.

arxiv is secondary, catching papers that huggingface's daily curation misses. the arxiv monitor searches cs.CL and cs.LG for quantisation, KV-cache, compression, and efficient inference papers from the last N days.

the combination means Oz sees new models within hours of upload, catches the papers that explain the techniques behind them, and can pull the full technical details from model cards without me navigating huggingface manually.

> Layer 4: The Model Stack.

Oz itself runs on glm-5.1 via Z.AI for interactive chat ($21/month) and glm-4.7 for cron jobs. fallback chain: local ollama models.

locally on the Mac Mini I have four models running through ollama: gemma 3 4B (36.7 tokens/sec, used for context compression because it's nearly 2x faster than qwen3.5-4B at the same task), qwen3.5-9B (13.5 tok/s, cron fallback and daily driver), gemma 3 12B and ministral 3 8B benchmarked and available for testing.

memory management matters on 16GB. ollama's OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=5m auto-unloads models after 5 minutes of inactivity so they don't sit in RAM when nothing is using them. I can run one model at a time comfortably, two small ones if I need to.

I also wrote auto-bench.sh which pulls any model from ollama, runs cold and warm benchmarks, records the results to a model catalog file, and optionally removes the model afterward. when something interesting drops on huggingface, I run the script and have comparable numbers on my own hardware within minutes. over time the catalog becomes a personal leaderboard I trust because I ran every number myself.

and ollama-rotate.sh cleans up unused models after 30 days, protecting essential ones (gemma3:4b and qwen3.5:9b are always kept). 16GB means I can't hoard models.

> Layer 5: The Cleanup.

a weekly launchd job handles maintenance: pruning sessions older than 7 days, clearing cron output, cleaning chrome cache (Oz has a browser-harness skill for scraping JS-heavy pages like huggingface leaderboards), and vacuuming the state database when it exceeds 200MB. right now it's at 794MB from three months of accumulated DeFi + AI research. the vacuum brings it back down.

## New Identity

here's what I deleted this morning, specifically:

grimoire (my content publishing system), grimoire-post-workflow, alpha-scanner, every skill in the defi/ directory, stablecoin-rwa-research, crypto-news-research, competitor-intel-dashboard, rwa-research-deepdive, defi-mechanics-research-brief, defi-metrics-monitor, defi-cron-monitor, draft-reviewer, content-draft-workflow, learning-digest-curator, and defi-mechanics-research-ingest.

17 skills. three months of accumulated configuration. gone in one morning. the old DeFi wiki pages are archived, not deleted. I might reference them. but Oz's SOUL.md (the identity file that tells the agent who it is) now reads:

```bash
"you are Oz, a personal AI assistant for Witcheer, 
a Local AI practitioner and builder. 

your primary mission: 
research and document everything about running AI locally. 
you maintain a structured wiki at ~/wiki/ and deliver daily research
findings via Telegram."
```

that's it. one mission. one wiki. one research loop. everything else is support infrastructure for that loop.

## Onward

I'm sharing this because I want to learn in public.

I don't know everything about local AI. I know how to run qwen3.5-9B on a Mac Mini. I know the token economics of cloud vs local. I know that ollama's MLX backend doubled my inference speed. I know that quantisation formats matter and I'm still learning which ones and why. I know that the quality gap between local and cloud models is closing faster than most people expect.

what I don't know yet is deeper: how to fine-tune a model on my own data, how to build a production RAG pipeline that actually works, how KV-cache optimisation affects long-context performance on apple silicon, which inference engine is fastest for which architecture on which hardware. that's what Oz is going to research for me, one wiki page at a time, every single evening.

the core loop is simple:

huggingface + arxiv feed the research pipeline. the research pipeline feeds the wiki. the wiki gets audited weekly. the quiz tests me three times a week. every day the knowledge base grows. every week it's cleaned. nothing gets lost. knowledge compounds.

if you're curious about running AI locally but haven't started, follow along. I'll post what Oz finds, what I benchmark on my own hardware, what breaks, and what surprises me. the hardware is cheaper than you think. the models are better than you expect. the tools are mature enough to build real workflows on.

I'm not an expert yet. I'm building the system that will make me one.
