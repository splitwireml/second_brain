# How to Build a Team of AI Agents That Actually Work Together (Full Course)

How to Build a Team of AI Agents That Actually Work Together (Full Course)

One AI agent is powerful. A team of AI agents working together is a completely different category.

Save this :)

On May 6th, 2026, Anthropic announced multi-agent orchestration for Claude Managed Agents at their Code with Claude event. You can now run up to 20 specialized agents working in parallel on a single task.

Not sequentially. In parallel. At the same time. Each one handling a different part of the problem.

This is the same architecture that Netflix, Harvey (the legal AI company), and Shopify are already using in production. Netflix uses it to analyze hundreds of build logs simultaneously. Harvey uses it to coordinate complex legal work across multiple documents. Shopify is pushing toward 90% autonomous coding by Q3 2026.

These are not experiments. These are production systems running at scale right now.

And the tools to build your own are available to everyone.

Here is exactly how to build a team of AI agents from scratch, what patterns work, and what mistakes to avoid.

## Why Multi-Agent Beats Single-Agent

A single agent is like a single employee. No matter how talented they are, they can only do one thing at a time. If the task has five parts, they handle them sequentially: part one, then part two, then part three, then part four, then part five.

A multi-agent system is like a team. Five agents, each specialized in one part of the task, working simultaneously. The work that takes a single agent 30 minutes takes a team of five agents 6 minutes.

But speed is not even the biggest advantage.

The real advantage is specialization.

A single agent asked to do everything — research, analysis, writing, coding, reviewing — produces mediocre results across the board because it is spreading its attention too thin.

A team of specialized agents — one researcher, one analyst, one writer, one coder, one reviewer — produces excellent results on every front because each agent focuses on what it does best.

This is the same reason human teams outperform individuals on complex projects.

The Three Multi-Agent Patterns That Work

Not all multi-agent setups are created equal. After studying how companies are deploying these systems, three patterns have emerged that consistently work.

## Pattern 1: The Pipeline

Agents work in sequence, each one passing its output to the next one.

Research Agent → Analysis Agent → Writing Agent → Review Agent

This works best when each step has a clear input and output, and later steps depend on earlier ones. The research agent finds the data. The analysis agent identifies patterns. The writing agent creates the report. The review agent checks it for errors.

Each agent is optimized for its specific task with a focused system prompt and relevant tools.

## Pattern 2: The Fan-Out

A commander agent breaks a large task into subtasks and distributes them to multiple worker agents in parallel.

Commander Agent assigns:

- Worker Agent 1 → analyze document A

- Worker Agent 2 → analyze document B

- Worker Agent 3 → analyze document C

- Worker Agent 4 → analyze document D

- Worker Agent 5 → analyze document E

All five workers run simultaneously. When they finish, their results are collected and synthesized.

This is the pattern Netflix uses for analyzing build logs. It is ideal for tasks where the same operation needs to be performed on many items independently.

## Pattern 3: The Specialist Team

Multiple agents with different specializations collaborate on a single complex task, each contributing their expertise.

For a product launch, you might have:

- Market Research Agent — analyzes competitor data and market trends

- Technical Agent — evaluates feasibility and architecture options

- Financial Agent — builds cost projections and pricing models

- Copy Agent — writes marketing materials and landing page copy

- Review Agent — checks everything for consistency and quality

Each agent works in its area of expertise. The outputs are combined into a comprehensive deliverable.

This is the pattern Harvey uses for legal work. Different agents handle different aspects of a case — research, precedent analysis, document drafting, compliance checking — and the results are assembled into a complete legal package.

## Step 1: Define Your Team

Before building anything, answer these questions:

What is the overall goal? "Produce a weekly competitive analysis report."

What are the distinct sub-tasks? "Research competitor websites, analyze pricing changes, monitor product launches, synthesize findings, write report."

Which sub-tasks can run in parallel? "Research, pricing analysis, and product monitoring can all happen simultaneously. Synthesis and writing must wait until those are done."

What specialist would you hire for each sub-task? "A market researcher, a pricing analyst, a product scout, a strategic analyst, and a report writer."

Each specialist becomes an agent with its own system prompt, tools, and focus area.

## Step 2: Design Each Agent

Every agent in your team needs three things:

A clear role. "You are a competitive pricing analyst. Your job is to track pricing changes across five competitor products and identify trends."

Specific tools. The pricing analyst needs web access to check competitor websites. The report writer needs file access to create documents. The market researcher needs web search to find recent news.

Defined outputs. "Produce a structured JSON file with fields: competitor_name, product, old_price, new_price, date_changed, significance_rating."

The output format matters because it is how agents communicate. If Agent A produces unstructured text and Agent B needs structured data, the handoff fails.

Standardize your output formats across agents. This is the most important technical decision you will make.

## Step 3: Build the Orchestration

With Claude Managed Agents, multi-agent orchestration is built into the API. You define your agents, their relationships, and how they communicate — Anthropic handles the infrastructure.

The key decisions:

Which agents run in parallel? Agents that do not depend on each other's output should run simultaneously to maximize speed.

Which agents run sequentially? Agents that need another agent's output should wait until that output is available.

How do agents pass data? Through files in the shared environment, through structured output formats, or through direct agent-to-agent communication.

What happens when an agent fails? Define fallback behavior. If the pricing analyst cannot access a competitor's website, it should log the failure and continue with available data — not crash the entire pipeline.

## Step 4: Add Memory with Dreaming

This is the newest feature and it changes everything about long-term agent performance.

Dreaming is a scheduled background process that runs between agent sessions. It reviews past sessions, extracts patterns, identifies recurring mistakes, and curates the agent's memory stores.

In practice, this means your agent team gets smarter over time without you manually updating prompts.

Harvey reported that enabling Dreaming on their legal agents increased completion rates approximately 6x. Not from a model change — purely from agents carrying institutional knowledge across sessions.

Your agent team literally learns from its own experience.

To enable Dreaming, configure a dream schedule in your Managed Agents setup. Nightly is the recommended cadence for most teams.

## Step 5: Define Outcomes

Outcomes are a new feature that lets you define what "success" looks like using a rubric-based grading system.

Instead of hoping your agents produce good output, you define specific criteria:

"The report must include pricing data from all five competitors. If any competitor data is missing, the completeness score drops below 80%. The analysis section must include at least three specific insights, not generic observations. The writing must be under 2,000 words."

Claude evaluates its own output against your rubric and iterates until it passes. This creates a quality loop that catches errors before you ever see the output.

## Step 6: Test With Simple Tasks First

Do not start by building a 10-agent system.

Start with two agents working together on a simple pipeline task. Get the communication right. Get the output formats right. Get the error handling right.

Then add a third agent. Then a fourth. Each addition should be tested independently before integration.

The teams that build great multi-agent systems are the ones that build incrementally, not the ones that try to design the perfect system on day one.

## Step 7: Monitor and Iterate

Multi-agent systems are more complex than single agents. More things can go wrong. Monitoring is not optional.

Watch for:

Handoff failures — agents producing output that the next agent cannot parse. Fix by tightening output format specifications.

Redundant work — multiple agents doing the same thing without realizing it. Fix by making each agent's scope extremely specific.

Quality degradation — output quality dropping as the pipeline gets longer. Fix by adding review agents at key checkpoints.

Token bloat — agents generating unnecessarily verbose output that eats token limits. Fix by adding constraints on output length.

What This Looks Like In Production

Here is a real multi-agent setup running in production right now:

## Weekly Market Intelligence Report

Agent 1: Web Research Agent — searches for recent news, product launches, and funding rounds in the target market. Runs in parallel.

Agent 2: Competitor Monitor Agent — checks five competitor websites for changes in pricing, features, and messaging. Runs in parallel.

Agent 3: Social Listener Agent — scans X and LinkedIn for relevant discussions, sentiment, and emerging trends. Runs in parallel.

Agent 4: Analysis Agent — receives data from Agents 1-3, identifies the five most significant developments, rates each by impact.

Agent 5: Report Writer Agent — takes the analysis and produces a formatted executive briefing with recommendations.

Agent 6: Quality Review Agent — checks the report against a defined rubric, flags issues, and requests revisions from the writer.

Total time: under 15 minutes. Previous time with a single agent: over an hour. Previous time doing it manually: half a day.

The report lands in Google Drive every Monday at 8am. The team reads it over coffee.

## Common Multi-Agent Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

Mistake 1: Making every agent too general. The whole point of multi-agent is specialization. If your Research Agent is also doing analysis and writing, you have missed the purpose. Each agent should do one thing extremely well. Narrow is powerful. Broad is weak.

Mistake 2: Not standardizing output formats. If your Research Agent produces a free-form paragraph and your Analysis Agent expects structured JSON, the handoff breaks. Before building any agent, define the data contract between agents. What fields? What format? What happens if a field is empty?

Mistake 3: Running too many agents in parallel too early. Start with two agents in a simple pipeline. Get the communication working. Then add a third. Then a fourth. Each addition introduces complexity. Manage it incrementally.

Mistake 4: No error handling between agents. What happens when one agent in the pipeline fails? Does the whole system crash? Does the next agent receive garbage input? Build explicit fallback behavior. "If the pricing data is unavailable, proceed with historical data and flag the gap in the final report."

Mistake 5: Ignoring token costs. Multi-agent setups use more tokens than single-agent runs. Each agent has its own context, its own reasoning, and its own output. Monitor your usage and optimize prompts to be concise without losing essential detail.

## The Future Is Multi-Agent

Anthropic is not building multi-agent orchestration as a nice-to-have feature. They are building it as the fundamental architecture for how AI systems will work going forward.

At the Code with Claude event, Anthropic showed that their own Cowork product was built using this architecture. Multiple specialized agents collaborating to handle complex tasks. The tool that builds things autonomously was built by tools working autonomously.

Apple just announced that Claude will be integrated into iOS 27 alongside other AI services through a new Extensions system. As Claude becomes embedded in more workflows and more devices, multi-agent becomes the natural way to handle complex, cross-domain tasks.

The companies investing in multi-agent infrastructure today — Netflix, Harvey, Shopify, Mercado Libre — are not doing it for fun. They are doing it because single-agent approaches cannot scale to the complexity of their real-world problems.

And the individual builders who learn these patterns now will have skills that are worth serious money in the very near future.

## The Honest Truth

Multi-agent systems are not magic. They are software engineering applied to AI.

The fundamentals are the same as building any team-based system: clear roles, clear communication, defined interfaces, error handling, and iteration.

The difference is that the "team" costs you a Claude subscription instead of six salaries, it works 24/7 without breaks, and it gets better over time through Dreaming.

We are at the very beginning of the multi-agent era. The people who figure out these patterns now — in May 2026 — will have a massive head start when this becomes the default way all AI systems work.

Most people will read this and think multi-agent is "too advanced" for them. The ones who build their first two-agent pipeline this week will realize it is much simpler than they expected.
