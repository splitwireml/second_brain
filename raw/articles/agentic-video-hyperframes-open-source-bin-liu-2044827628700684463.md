# Agentic Video is HTML: Open Sourcing HyperFrames

Agentic Video is HTML: Open Sourcing HyperFrames

AI agents can write, can code, can talk, and operate autonomously — but they still cannot edit videos — now they can.

Today we're open-sourcing HyperFrames — an HTML-based video toolchain and rendering framework built for AI agents.

With HyperFrames, Claude Code is now our in-house Video Editor.

Try giving the HyperFrames Skill to your Agent, they will immediately start to build videos by writing HTML (and JS + CSS), then render them into MP4, MOV or WebM.

## HTML for Video Editing? What?

> What the symphony was to Beethoven, play was to Shakespeare — HTML is to agents.

AI Agents shouldn’t be learning After Effects or DaVinci Resolve, theJSON or XML based tools are simply not built for Agents, they are built for humans.

Agents (LLMs) were trained on the web. Billions of pages of HTML. Millions of CSS & JavaScript animations. Hundreds of thousands of GSAP snippets, SVG compositions, Canvas experiments. The web is the largest creative medium in their training data by orders of magnitude.

When you let agents write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, they're working in their native tongue.

So we take their best work, add a thin set of HyperFrames' `data-` attributes, done, HTML becomes the the best agent-native video editing tool chain.

We have some proof. This is our launch video - created by prompting Claude Code to use HyperFrames:

# HyperFrames' backstory

HeyGen started by helping millions of people create AI avatars to replace the camera — but we quickly learned that the avatar is only half the story. People still need to add complex motion graphics, B-rolls, and visual storytelling to make their videos engaging.

Mastering video editing is incredibly hard. It always involves a complex timeline, layers, keyframes — skills that take years to learn. After Effects is even more difficult for most people. So we took a different route and started experimenting with using HTML & JavaScript to make motion graphics for our users' videos.

We eventually landed on adopting GSAP — a JavaScript animation library. We built it into our Video Editor so users can add editable motion graphics to their videos:

At the time, Agents weren't good enough. Building Motion Designs by writing HTML+CSS+JS based animations was still quite challenging. It required a lot of back-and-forth and often needed engineers to manually build them

(yes, you heard it right, hand-written code).

But we already knew that code → video was the direction.

So we started experimenting with ways to further automate motion graphics and B-rolls and started integrating them into our Video Agent. And it was WILDLY successful. It became the #1 thing users kept raving about:

> "The illustrative animations are fantastic!"

As you can tell, production quality jumps up when Motion Graphics are added:

With this success, we know we are onto something: our Video Agent was already pulling together multimedia assets into continous scenes and illustrating ideas with motion graphics. All done through code-gen. But the models weren’t quite there yet to produce reliable or creative output on their own.

> Then came November 2025, Gemini 3 and Opus 4.5 previewed.

We swapped them into our agent — and voilà. Video Agent started producing motion graphics and multi-scene b-rolls consistently and with high-quality.

Furthermore, with pure HTML+CSS+JavaScript, we were able to get full-length videos, aesthetically striking and engaging, built from the most basic HTML primitives and JavaScript animations. Almost production-ready.

That's when we started converging on the earliest versions of HyperFrames.

# How does HyperFrames work?

HyperFrames got its name because it turns HTML (HyperText Markup Language) into Video Frames: Hyper---Frames.

On top of the standard Web syntax, HyperFrames simply require a handful of `data-` attributes to be added to HTML elements so we can define a video timeline:

Here’s a super simple example of HyperFrames-based video’s HTML code:

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.14.2/dist/gsap.min.js"></script>
  <style>
    body { margin:0; width:1920px; height:1080px; overflow:hidden; background:#0D1B2A; }
    .scene { position:absolute; inset:0; width:1920px; height:1080px; overflow:hidden; background:#0D1B2A; }
    #scene2 { z-index:2; opacity:0; }

    .s1 { display:flex; flex-direction:column; justify-content:center; width:100%; height:100%; padding:120px 160px; gap:20px; box-sizing:border-box; }
    .s2 { display:flex; flex-direction:column; justify-content:center; align-items:center; width:100%; height:100%; padding:100px 160px; gap:32px; box-sizing:border-box; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root" data-composition-id="hyperframes-intro"
       data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-start="0" data-duration="5">
    <div id="scene1" class="scene">
      <div class="s1">
        <div class="s1-title">HTML is Video</div>
        <div class="s1-sub">Compose. Animate. Render.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="scene2" class="scene">
      <div class="s2-title">Start composing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <script>
    window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
    var tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });

    // Scene 1 — title entrance
    tl.from(".s1-title", { x:-40, opacity:0, duration:0.5, ease:"power3.out" }, 0.25);
    tl.from(".s1-sub", { y:15, opacity:0, duration:0.4, ease:"power2.out" }, 0.5);

    // Blur crossfade transition
    var T = 2.2;
    tl.to("#scene1", { filter:"blur(8px)", scale:1.03, opacity:0, duration:0.35, ease:"power2.inOut" }, T);
    tl.fromTo("#scene2",
      { filter:"blur(8px)", scale:0.97, opacity:0 },
      { filter:"blur(0px)", scale:1, opacity:1, duration:0.35, ease:"power2.inOut" }, T + 0.08);

    // Fade out
    tl.to(".s2-title", { y:-12, opacity:0, duration:0.3, ease:"power2.in" }, 4.5);
    tl.to(".s2-cmd", { y:-8, opacity:0, duration:0.3, ease:"power2.in" }, 4.6);

    window.__timelines["hyperframes-intro"] = tl;
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This is a complete video composition in under 70 lines. Scene one fades in a title and scene two blur-crossfades into a CTA — all in 5 seconds. `data-start` and `data-duration` control timing. `data-track-index` controls layering. GSAP drives animation. Everything else is just HTML, CSS & JS:

Anything that works in a browser works in Hyperframes. CSS animations, GSAP timelines, Lottie, Three.js, D3 visualizations, Google Fonts — the agent can use whatever web technology it already knows. No wrappers. No heavy handed framework-to-learn.

Of course, much more thought have gone into architecting HyperFrames, we will release a more detailed technical blogs in the coming weeks.

## There you have it - HyperFrames:

- It lets agents build videos through HTML

- Create, Preview, Render all done locally.

- Fully open source today at [https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes)

One command, make your Agent a Video Editor:

```bash
npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes
```

## Why open source?

Video is one of the most effective communication medium, and Agents should be able to create videos to communicate with humans with rich visualization. But the friction today is immense, because all the video building tools today are not architected for Agents.

We're open-sourcing HyperFrames to remove that friction entirely: any agent, any LLM, zero API keys, instant video, all done locally.

More fundamentally, we believe HTML is the format for the future of video. We are dedicated to build this future, together with the broader community who share that same conviction.

## THANK YOU!

@joshua_xu_  @yanrong @kimsanovv7 @davidttjjss @toolstelegraph @yaboinick @emse_jianle @jieun @JeaneCarlosX

And we drew inspiration from some of the best open source projects out there: @greensock , @Remotion,  @openclaw  and others. And we're open sourcing everything we've built so far — core engine, studio, renderer, skills, examples — all under Apache 2.0.

We are all-in on HyperFrames and will constantly be building and collaborating with anyone who wants to contribute to HyperFrames.
