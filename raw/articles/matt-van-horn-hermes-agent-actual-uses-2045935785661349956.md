# Hermes Agent: What People Are Actually Using It For (/Last30Days of Reddit, X, and YouTube)

Hermes Agent: What People Are Actually Using It For (/Last30Days of Reddit, X, and YouTube)

## 1. 📞 Pre-call client research

The highest-signal business use. The r/hermesagent thread "How are you actually using Hermes for your business? Not hobby stuff, real workflows" (19 comments) has one canonical answer from the OP:

> "Client research before calls. I tell it who I'm meeting and it pulls together everything relevant and sends me a summary before the call. Saves me 20-30 mins every time."

This is the first thing business operators set up and the last thing they turn off. The Reddit replies echo it: pre-meeting dossiers, company-news digests, and "who is this person on LinkedIn and what did they ship recently."

This is a killer use case for /last30days, I'm glad a community member built a way to use /last30days in Hermes.

## 2. ✉️ Meeting-note to follow-up drafting

The quietly universal second use. Same r/hermesagent thread: after meetings, Hermes takes rough notes and turns them into polished follow-ups. No integrations, just agent + notes file + draft.

The power-user variant writes TODOs back into TODOS.md in Obsidian with matching tag style (per r/hermesagent "Hermes Agent won't remember my rules," 18 comments). The persistent-memory angle only matters here because the agent has to remember your existing tag conventions across sessions.

## 3. 🎧 The weekly podcast digest

The workflow people keep bragging about. r/MistralAI's "Replaced 10+ hours of podcast listening with a 2hr Hermes Agent workflow using Voxtral" (39 upvotes) documents the canonical recipe:

1. Weekly cron pulls the latest episodes from subscribed feeds
2. Voxtral transcribes
3. Mistral Large 3 ranks each segment against stated interests
4. Hermes stitches the top segments into a highlights reel

r/openclaw has the simpler variant (10-minute clips per podcast, run weekly). A second r/hermesagent user runs the same shape but for long-form YouTube.

## 4. 📬 Daily news briefings pushed to Telegram or Discord

The default starter workflow. r/TunisiaTech's "Use cases of OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, etc." thread says it plainly:

> "Currently I have daily cron jobs for news briefing, but I know there's much more I can do. I'm using GitHub student plan, Gemini API, sometimes Ollama."

Corey Ganim's X post in the 2M-view range sells the exact same pattern: $5 server, daily cron, Telegram/Discord/WhatsApp delivery. Petronella Tech's 2026 guide adds DevOps-flavored variants: SSL checks, uptime monitoring, and server status piped to Discord on the same cron scaffold.

## 5. ⚙️ The content-ops pipeline: blogs, cold emails, lead scraping

The small-business workflow. r/openclaw's "Fed up baby sitting Openclaw, found a better Alternative" (37 comments) lists the use case verbatim:

> "writing blogs for our projects, cold emailing leads, scraping leads from YC, Twitter, Reddit."

The migration story is specifically about these three tasks moving from OpenClaw to Hermes because OpenClaw needed too much babysitting. r/AISEOInsider threads describe the multi-agent Telegram variant: one Hermes researches, another drafts, a third reviews, a fourth publishes, coordinated through shared folders. @JulianGoldieSEO's "connect to Hermes, plug into OpenClaw, run agent teams, automate workflows in the cloud" frames the same pattern.

## 6. 💬 The 24/7 personal assistant across Telegram and WhatsApp

The biggest consumer use. jay_k.xyz's TikTok frames it directly:

> "fragmented tools, lost context across sessions, endless debugging. Hermes Agent (Nous Research) fixes it - open-source CLI framework with persistent memory."

The core loop: one Hermes instance, all channels, remembers your preferences across sessions, handles tasks you delegate from wherever you happen to be.

r/hermesagent "Yes, Hermes and Qwen3.5:4b is all I need" (160 upvotes, 36 comments) is the cheap-tier version running on a Raspberry Pi for $10/month. Alex Finn's 105K-view YouTube walkthrough shows the enthusiast variant: multiple Hermes instances, one fully local on Qwen 3.5, with a custom Obsidian memory layer on top.

## 7. 🛡️ Hermes as watchdog for another agent

The advanced ops pattern. Per mejba.me: Hermes on a 2-hour cron checks OpenClaw's scanners, logs, and baselines, pushing summaries to Telegram. Geeky-gadgets documents Hermes detecting an OpenClaw failure, patching the broken API key config, and restarting with 11 seconds of downtime.

@gkisokay on X (70 likes) recommends the real-time variant: run Codex with GPT-5.4 as a monitor on any Hermes-driven workflow, live-coding fixes as drift appears. @JayTL00 names the failure this fixes:

> "49 agents coordinating 72 workflows sounds impressive on paper. The real bottleneck running multi-agent setups in Hermes isn't model quality, it's the coordinator."

## 🧵 What ties all seven together

Every workflow on this list shares three properties:

- Scheduled - cron or event-driven, rarely interactive

- File-based - reads and writes markdown, JSON, or plain text

- Pushes results to a messenger rather than a dashboard

The self-evolving skill loop matters because it makes these workflows sticky. The first run of the podcast clipper takes 23 tool calls. The third takes 6. After that, the saved skill compounds.

But almost no one sets up Hermes for the learning loop. They set it up to get a daily digest at 7am. The learning loop is why they don't turn it off.

## 🔑 Key Patterns from the Research

1. Pre-call client research - auto-enriched dossier delivered before every meeting, saves 20-30 minutes per call

2. Meeting-note to follow-up drafting - rough notes in, polished emails out, writes TODOs into Obsidian with matching tag style

3. Weekly podcast digest - Voxtral + Mistral Large 3 pipeline, 10 hours of listening compressed to a 2-hour highlights reel

4. Daily news briefings to Telegram/Discord - cheap-tier cron deployment (GitHub student plan + Gemini + Ollama, $5 VPS)

5. Content-ops pipeline - blog drafts, cold emails, YC/X/Reddit lead scraping, often as multi-agent Telegram chains

6. 24/7 personal assistant across Telegram/WhatsApp - persistent memory, same agent across channels, Raspberry Pi for $10/mo

7. Agent watchdog and auto-healer - Hermes monitoring OpenClaw on 2hr cron, patching config and restarting on failure in under 15 seconds
