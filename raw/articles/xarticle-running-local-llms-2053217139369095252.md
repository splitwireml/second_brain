# Running Local LLMs: From First Run to Fine-Tuned

Running Local LLMs: From First Run to Fine-Tuned

## 0. TL;DR

Most people who struggle with local LLMs aren't stuck because the technology is hard. They're stuck because they don't know which layer they're stuck on.

You think you're just running a model. You're actually making five decisions at once: hardware, memory, runtime, model selection, and quantization. Each layer has its own failure modes, each can be optimized independently, and they all constrain each other. Almost every problem traces back to one of these five.

Two ways to read this: if you just want something running, §1 gets you there in ten minutes. If you're already tuning speed, context length, and quantization, §3 through §6 are the reference you want.

## 1. Get Something Running First

Don't start with 70B models, Q4 deep-dives, or GGUF format discussions. Get a model talking on your machine first.

Apple Silicon Macs are the simplest starting point right now. Three commands, ten minutes:

```
bash
brew install ollama   # No Homebrew? Download the installer directly from ollama.com
ollama pull qwen3:8b  # Tag not found? Check ollama.com/library for current available tags
ollama run qwen3:8b
```

Why qwen3:8b:

- small enough (~5GB at Q4 quantization),

- smart enough for real use,

- runs on 8GB of RAM,

- handles both English and Chinese.

- You don't need to optimize model choice on your first run.

Once downloaded, you'll see a >>> prompt. Ask it anything, watch it respond. Then run two more commands:

```
bash
ollama list              # Installed models: name, quantization, file size
ollama show qwen3:8b     # Model details: quant level, chat template, layers, context length

```

Reading the numbers:

- tokens/s (TPS): generation speed. On Apple M-series with an 8B model, expect 20–60 TPS — feels responsive. Below 5 TPS means a memory or quantization issue.

- prompt eval: time to first token. Depends on model size and context length.

- Memory usage: above 80% and you should start paying attention — system overhead will push latency up and may trigger swap.

You're running. Now let's unpack why it works.

## 2. Hardware: Bandwidth Is the Real Metric

Most people shopping for local LLM hardware focus on GPU compute (FLOPS). That instinct is wrong.

Local inference is almost always memory-bandwidth-limited, not compute-limited. Every time the model generates a token, the model weights get read from memory to the compute units. Weights are fixed — they get read every single step. Bandwidth determines how fast that read happens, and therefore caps your TPS.

This is why Apple Silicon consistently outperforms expectations for local LLM work.

Apple Silicon path

M-series chips use a Unified Memory architecture: CPU and GPU share the same memory pool, there's no discrete VRAM, and the path from memory to GPU cores is extremely short. Bandwidth efficiency is far higher than a discrete GPU connected over PCIe.

- MacBook Pro M4 Max: two tiers — 410 GB/s (14-core CPU) and 546 GB/s (16-core CPU / 40-core GPU). The 128GB config usually maps to the higher 546 GB/s tier.

- Mac Studio M3 Ultra: 819 GB/s memory bandwidth, large memory options available — the most capable consumer Apple desktop path for local LLM work.

NVIDIA path

- RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM): ~1008 GB/s bandwidth, the consumer single-card ceiling

- RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM): ~936 GB/s, lower cost, supports NVLink multi-GPU

- Multi-GPU: 3090s can pool VRAM via NVLink. 4090 multi-GPU is typically model parallelism, not VRAM pooling — you can't simply think of two 4090s as 48GB usable VRAM

- Datacenter cards (A100, H100): significantly higher bandwidth, significantly higher price — not a consumer option

## 3. Memory Math: The Real Constraint

Hardware sets the ceiling. Memory math tells you what fits inside it.

Local model memory usage breaks down into two parts:

Total memory ≈ weights + KV cache + runtime overhead

Weights are straightforward to calculate:

Weights = parameters × bytes per parameter

FP16 / BF16  ≈ 2 bytes/param    →  8B FP16 ≈ 16 GB
Q8            ≈ 1 byte/param     →  8B Q8  ≈  8 GB
Q4            ≈ 0.5 byte/param   →  8B Q4  ≈  4 GB  (+20% overhead ≈ 5 GB)
Q3            ≈ 0.375 byte/param →  8B Q3  ≈  3 GB

8B FP16 ≈ 16GB. Q8 ≈ 8GB. Q4 ≈ 4–5GB. This is why Q4 is the sweet spot.

KV Cache is the second variable — and the one most people ignore:

KV Cache ≈ 2 × num_layers × num_kv_heads × head_dim × seq_len × batch_size × bytes/element

Note: modern models widely use GQA (Grouped Query Attention) or MQA (Multi-Query Attention), where the number of KV heads is smaller than the number of attention heads. The formula uses num_kv_heads, not the full num_heads. For single-user chat, batch_size is typically 1.

KV Cache scales linearly with context size. 128K vs 4K context is 32× the KV Cache. Total memory impact depends on how much of your budget is weights vs KV Cache.

Context size is the hidden memory killer

The most common beginner mistake: assuming memory usage is fixed once the model loads. Context window size is the actual memory variable.

```
bash
# Set context size via API options
# (Ollama parameter names change across versions — num_ctx is the stable approach)
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3:8b",
    "prompt": "Explain KV Cache",
    "options": { "num_ctx": 32768 },
    "stream": false
  }'

```

qwen3:8b defaults to a 4096 context. Bumping to 32K, the memory difference is almost entirely KV Cache. This isn't a bug — longer context means more KV Cache to store previously computed tokens.

Read this chart for ratios, not absolutes: the gap between 4K and 32K context on the same model is almost entirely the KV Cache segment.

ok, so what do you actually run on your machine?

4. Runtime: Pick the Right Tool, Then Stop Thinking About It

You think you're using qwen3:8b. You're actually using Ollama first — it decides how the model loads, which chat template gets applied, how many layers go to GPU. Runtime makes a lot of choices for you before you understand the model.

Advanced users who want full control can skip Ollama and call llama.cpp directly. Everything Ollama handles for you, you now specify manually:

```
bash
./llama-cli \
  --model ./models/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  --ctx-size 32768 \      # context window size
  --n-gpu-layers 99 \     # GPU layers to offload, 99 = all
  --flash-attn on \       # Flash Attention
  --jinja                 # use the model's own chat template — fixes a lot of mysterious quality issues

```

--jinja is worth calling out: it tells llama.cpp to use the model's bundled chat template instead of a default. Adding this flag makes a lot of inexplicable quality problems disappear.

Local models aren't just chat UIs. Once running, they connect to your agents, scripts, and toolchains via API:

```
bash
# Ollama native API (/api/generate)
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3:8b",
    "prompt": "Explain KV Cache in three sentences",
    "stream": false
  }'
# For OpenAI-compatible clients, use /v1/chat/completions
# Change one base_url in your code and you switch from cloud to local

```

One boundary to state clearly: this article covers local single-machine inference. If you need multi-user production serving, that's vLLM and SGLang territory — a completely different set of tradeoffs.

## 5. Model Selection: Read the Filename First

A model filename on HuggingFace might look like this:

Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M.gguf

Every segment means something. Read it and you know exactly what you're downloading.

5a. Base / Instruct / Chat

Same model family, very different behavior. Base continues your prompt — it doesn't answer, it completes. Instruct has been fine-tuned to follow instructions. Chat adds dialog formatting on top. For local use, you almost always want Instruct or Chat. Base is for continued training.

The prompt format trap

Instruct models are sensitive to prompt format. Different model families use different chat templates. Qwen3 and Llama 3 format differently:

Wrong (raw prompt sent directly):
"Explain KV Cache"

Correct (Qwen3 chat template — let your runtime handle this automatically):

```
<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful assistant.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Explain KV Cache
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant

```

Ollama applies the correct template automatically. llama.cpp with --jinja does too. Wrong format produces mysteriously poor output — a real-world failure mode that gets misdiagnosed as "this model is bad."

5b. Quantization: trading memory for quality

Quantization compresses weights from FP16 (16-bit float) to fewer bits. A 16GB 8B FP16 model becomes a ~5GB Q4 model. You lose a little precision, you gain the ability to actually load it.

FP16/BF16 → Q8 → Q6 → Q4 → Q3 → Q2
Quality: high ←——————————————→ low
Size:    large ←——————————————→ small

K-quants: the K in Q4_K_M stands for K-means clustering. _M/_S/_L is Medium/Small/Large — the quantization granularity. K-quants consistently outperform naive uniform quantization at the same bit width.

Practical quantization rules:

- Memory to spare → Q8 (closest to FP16 quality)

- Quality-sensitive with limited memory → Q5_K_M or Q6_K_M

- Everyday use → Q4_K_M (the sweet spot)

- Memory forces your hand → Q3 (carefully), Q2 almost never

A counterintuitive result: a Q4 8B model outperforms an FP16 3B model on most everyday tasks. Quantization does introduce loss, but the gains from a larger model architecture usually outweigh it at Q4. Choosing a bigger model at Q4 is almost always better than choosing a smaller model at FP16.

5c. MoE: total parameters ≠ active parameters

The A3B suffix is where most people get confused. It's telling you: the model has 30B total parameters, but only ~3B are activated per inference.

- Memory requirement: based on total parameters — all weights load into memory

- Compute: based on active parameters — only these participate in each inference pass

So 30B-A3B: needs ~18GB of memory at Q4 (to hold all 30B weights), but each inference step computes like a ~3B model. Actual speed is still affected by how fast those 30B weights can be read from memory, runtime implementation, and hardware bandwidth — it's not literally 3B speed, but it's meaningfully faster than a dense 30B.

MoE lets you fit a higher total parameter count into the same memory budget. That's the real value. But quality still depends on training data, routing quality, and quantization — MoE is not inherently smarter.

Bigger isn't always better: for local agent use and tool calling, latency and instruction-following stability often matter more than benchmark rankings. A responsive 14B that reliably follows instructions may be more useful day-to-day than a slow 70B.

## 6. Optimization: From Running to Running Well

If your model is already fast enough and accurate enough, skip this section. Come back when you have a specific bottleneck.

6a. Core parameters

```
bash
# Ollama: set parameters via API options (more stable across versions)
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3:8b",
    "prompt": "Your question here",
    "options": {
      "num_ctx": 8192,    # context window size — directly affects KV Cache memory
      "num_gpu": 99,      # GPU layers to offload, 99 = all
      "num_batch": 512    # batch size for prompt processing
    },
    "stream": false
  }'
```

temperature, top_p, top_k control generation randomness — not performance knobs. Leave them at defaults unless you have a specific reason.

6b. Attention optimization

Flash Attention: standard attention materializes the full attention matrix in memory. Flash Attention computes it in tiles, dramatically reducing memory reads and writes. Same context size, faster and cheaper. Enabled with --flash-attn on in llama.cpp; check your runtime's docs to confirm whether it's on by default.

KV Cache quantization: quantize the KV Cache itself (typically to Q8 or Q4). Meaningfully reduces memory at 32K+ context lengths.

6c. Smart quantization: imatrix

Standard quantization applies the same precision reduction uniformly to all weights. imatrix (Importance Matrix) quantization first runs a calibration dataset, measures how much each weight group affects outputs, then applies aggressive compression to unimportant weights while preserving precision on important ones.

Same Q4 target, but imatrix Q4 consistently produces better output quality than standard Q4. On HuggingFace, imat or imatrix in the filename is a good sign.

Turbo Quant is a similar technique under a different name — importance-guided non-uniform quantization is the underlying idea.

6d. Emerging inference acceleration

Speculative decoding: a small draft model generates candidate tokens quickly, then the main model verifies them in batch. Verified tokens are used directly; only rejected ones get recomputed. Can meaningfully improve TPS when draft and main models are well-matched. Same model family usually works best for the draft, but isn't strictly required.

MTP (Multi-Token Prediction): instead of predicting one token per forward pass, the model predicts multiple. Some newer models have this built into training, so no separate draft model is needed. Both approaches point in the same direction: more output per forward pass.

6e. Don't just watch TPS

TPS measures speed, not quality. A fast model that hallucinates is useless.

Skip the benchmarks. Test on your actual tasks. Four things to check in under ten minutes:

1. Instruction following: give it a task with a specific output format (e.g. JSON with exact fields). Does it comply consistently?

2. Long context: paste a 2,000-word document, then ask about a detail from the final paragraph. Does it still have it?

3. Code: ask it to write a simple function. Copy it out, run it. Does it pass?

4. Hallucination: ask a factual question you know the answer to. Does it make things up?

Ten minutes of real-task testing tells you more than any public benchmark.

## 7. Glossary

## 8. The Five Layers, One More Time

When a model won't run, don't blame the model first. Ask: is it a memory issue? Context too large? Wrong quantization? Runtime misconfigured?

Each layer can be optimized independently, but they constrain each other:

- Better runtime doesn't help if bandwidth is the bottleneck

- Lower quantization frees memory but costs quality

- The best model in the world won't run if it doesn't fit

Understanding the stack is understanding local LLMs.

If you've found a configuration that works well on your hardware, share it.
