# How we got 207 tok/s with Qwen3.5-27B on an RTX 3090

How we got 207 tok/s with Qwen3.5-27B on an RTX 3090

Co-author: @davideciffa

We built a standalone C++/ggml speculative decoder for Qwen3.5-27B Q4_K_M with a DFlash block-diffusion draft.

The demo video below shows a 207.6 tok/s run (5.46x over AR); the HumanEval 10-prompt bench averages 129.5 tok/s at DDTree budget=22, single RTX 3090, 24 GB. 3.43x over autoregressive and 2.8x over the best public SGLang AWQ number.

## TL;DR

- Up to 207 tok/s in the demo video (peak 207.6 tok/s DFlash vs 38.0 tok/s AR, 5.46x). HumanEval 10-prompt bench: 129.5 tok/s mean at DDTree budget=22.

- 3.43x over autoregressive Q4_K_M baseline (37.78 tok/s).

- 2.8x vs the SGLang AWQ reference (46.6 tok/s) we tracked on the same RTX 3090.

- 128K context fits on 24 GB. Q4_0 KV cache + rolling 4096-slot target feature buffer. HE bench: 134.78 tok/s at ctx=131072.

- Only ggml. We never link libllama. Engine is ~2000 LOC of C++/CUDA built into libdflash27b.a around ggml_gated_delta_net.

## Why the experiment exists

Qwen3.5-27B is a hybrid model: every 4th layer is full softmax attention, the rest (48 of 64) are Gated DeltaNet. M-RoPE with dimension sections [11, 11, 10, 0], 24 Q heads, 4 KV heads, key/value length 256, and an SSM state cache alongside the usual KV cache.

That combination doesn't have a good single-3090 decode path today:

- llama.cpp has the GGUF loader and ggml_gated_delta_net, but no DFlash speculative decoding.

- vLLM / SGLang both ship z-lab's DFlash integration, but only on BF16 weights (54 GB, doesn't fit on 24 GB). No GGUF path for Qwen3.5-27B on either runtime (broken on SGLang as of 2026-04). AWQ target on SGLang runs plain AR at 46.6 tok/s on one RTX 3090 but can't host a BF16 draft + DDTree tree state in 24 GB.

- z-lab's reference benchmarks run BF16 on NVIDIA B200, 54+ GB VRAM class. No public path to a 24 GB consumer card.

We wanted the fastest single-3090 decode we could get on a 24 GB consumer card. The answer turned out to be: port only the graph glue to ggml, keep the DeltaNet kernel that already exists, run DFlash block-diffusion draft with a DDTree verifier, and compress the KV cache to Q4_0 for long context.

## Architecture

The library is hardcoded for one model pair:

Greedy verify, block size 16, CUDA only, single RTX 3090. The build links libggml*.a and nothing from libllama. If you deleted deps/llama.cpp/src/ it would still compile.

## Layout

Oracle: the PyTorch reference at megaqwen3_27b_dflash/reference/dflash_reference.py, cross-checked against the z-lab AutoModel forward at cos sim 0.999812.

## From autoregressive to DDTree

Configurations on the same 10-prompt HumanEval bench, n_gen=256, RTX 3090, Q4_K_M target, bf16 draft. Rows 1–5 are the historical tuning sweep (commit f1cb9bf, AR baseline 37.44 tok/s). Row 6 is the fresh 2026-04-20 run on commit 5bb7f8c (AR baseline 37.78 tok/s). Speedup is computed against each row's contemporaneous AR:

AL = average accept length (tokens accepted per verify step). DDTree paper reports +35–42% over chain DFlash on pure-attention Qwen3-4B/8B/30B-MoE (A100/B200, BF16). On our hybrid Q4_K_M/RTX 3090 combo we see +15% over chain. We think the gap comes from Q4 quantization flattening the draft softmax, which we partially patched with a chain pre-seed in build_ddtree.

Draft-accuracy ceiling. Budget sweep at 20/30/40 with f16 intermediate cache plateaus AL at ~8.9. Budget 30 gives AL 8.86 (120.49 tok/s), budget 40 gives AL 8.90 (105.10 tok/s). We are draft-ceiling bound, not verify-memory bound: a bigger tree would not help, only a better draft would.

## Key wins (day-by-day log, condensed)

- f16 intermediate cache: half the memory bandwidth, +5% tok/s at the same tree budget. Bit-identical to autoregressive at 40 tokens.

- Persist-write kernel (ggml_gated_delta_net_tree_persist): skips a 9 ms ggml_cpy per step, +11% across all prompts.

- D2D draft target_feat copy: removes a GPU→CPU→GPU roundtrip, cudaMemcpyAsync saves ~3 ms/step (+3.3%).

- OpenMP top-K extract, K=32→8: -7% on the draft_logits step.

- Tree-aware ggml_ssm_conv_tree: sibling nodes gather their conv window along the parent chain, not DFS order. Ports SGLang's causal_conv1d_triton HAS_EAGLE_TREE_CUSTOM_ATTN_MASK.

- target_feat compaction after sibling accept: fixed stale draft features on tree branch walks, unlocked real tree rescue on 9/10 prompts.

- Fast K=1 path at budget=15: skip the 11 ms CPU top-K extract when no siblings are needed.

- extract_draft_topk reverse bug: sort_heap + cmp_greater already produces descending order; an extra std::reverse was sending the worst candidate to the tree root (accept=1 every step). One-line fix.

- verify_logits_buf overflow: sized vocab*q_len but DDTree reads vocab*(budget+1) past budget 15. Silent memory corruption. One-line size fix.

## 128K context on 24 GB

Flash-attention in ggml-cuda supports Q4_0 K+V natively, so the KV cache compression is just ggml_cpy with the built-in F32→Q4_0 quantizer on write. 8x compression over f16.

Combined with a rolling 4096-slot target_feat ring (wrap-around writes, split reads across the wrap boundary), target_feat shrinks from 6.6 GB to 0.2 GB at 128K. One binary, env-selectable:

Tradeoffs: Q4_0 KV costs ~3% quality on HE (AL 8.56 -> 8.33) at short context and is dramatically better at long context. It's the only thing that lets 128K fit at all on 24 GB.

## Prefill

- Short prompts (≤2048 tok): PREFILL_UBATCH=16. Matches DFlash block size and chain-verify q_len, minimizes FA tile drift.

- Long prompts (>2048 tok): auto-bump to PREFILL_UBATCH=192. 13K prefill: 40.9 s -> 15.07 s (2.7x, ~913 tok/s). Larger batches OOM the embedded intermediate-state region inside ggml_gated_delta_net.

- Override via DFLASH27B_PREFILL_UBATCH=N.

- Full llama.cpp-parity prefill (~1500 tok/s) still needs a no_inter op variant that skips the embedded dst region, unblocking UBATCH > 192.

## What comes next

- Daemon mode: keep the model resident across turns, first-token latency 10 s → ms. Chat REPL + OpenAI server both respawn test_dflash per request today.

- Temperature / top-k sampling in the verify path. Currently greedy-only; temperature / top_p on the OpenAI server are accepted and ignored.

- Q5_K_M / Q6_K target support. Q4_K_M costs ~30 points of per-position accept vs the paper's BF16; higher-quality GGUF quants should recover most of it, if they fit.

- Full llama.cpp integration: new qwen35 arch, llama-speculative-dflash.cpp, llama-cli / llama-server wiring.

- no_inter op variant to unblock larger prefill ubatches (current ceiling: UBATCH=192; full llama.cpp-parity prefill ~1500 tok/s).

- Metal/Vulkan backends: not planned. Single-binary CUDA only. Anyone who wants Metal can fork.

As soon as Qwen3.6-27B comes out, we'll do the same for it. Repo in the first comment (open source, MIT).
